description: In this micrograph of neurons grown in culture, the tan threads are nerve
  cells, and the round tan beads are synapses, the connections that form between nerve
  cells. Changes in these connections are believed to underlie learning and memory
  (Image from the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, National Institute
